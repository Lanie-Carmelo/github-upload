          Helen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American
          author, disability rights advocate, political activist and lecturer.
          Born in West Tuscumbia, Alabama, she lost her sight and hearing after
          a bout of illness at the age of nineteen months. She then communicated
          primarily using home signs until the age of seven when she met her
          first teacher and life-long companion Anne Sullivan, who taught her
          language, including reading and writing; Sullivan's first lessons
          involved spelling words on Keller's hand to show her the names of
          objects around her. She also learned how to speak and to understand
          other people's speech using the Tadoma method. After an education at
          both specialist and mainstream schools, she attended Radcliffe College
          of Harvard University and became the first deafblind person to earn a
          Bachelor of Arts degree. She worked for the American Foundation for
          the Blind (AFB) from 1924 until 1968, during which time she toured the
          United States and traveled to 35 countries around the globe advocating
          for those with vision loss.

          Keller was a prolific author, writing 14 books and hundreds of
          speeches and essays on topics ranging from animals to Mahatma Gandhi.
          Keller campaigned for those with disabilities, for women’s suffrage,
          labor rights, and world peace. She joined the Socialist Party of
          America in 1909. She was a supporter of the NAACP and an original
          member of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1933, when her book
          How I Became a Socialist was burned by Nazi youth, she wrote an open
          letter to the Student Body of Germany condemning censorship and
          prejudice.

          The story of Keller and Sullivan was made famous by Keller's 1903
          autobiography, The Story of My Life, and its adaptations for film and
          stage, The Miracle Worker. Her birthplace is now a museum and sponsors
          an annual "Helen Keller Day". Her June 27 birthday is commemorated as
          Helen Keller Day in Pennsylvania and, in the centenary year of her
          birth, was recognized by a presidential proclamation from U.S.
          President Jimmy Carter.

          She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1971 and was
          one of twelve inaugural inductees to the Alabama Writers Hall of Fame
          on June 8, 2015.
